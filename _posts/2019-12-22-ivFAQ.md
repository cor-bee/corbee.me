## What is Instant View?

Instant View is a Telegram feature, which allows users to read articles with ~zero pageload time. This is achieved by caching pages on Telegram servers â€” without ads, styles and JavaScript. 
Only pure HTML, only hardcore ðŸ¤˜

## How to create a Template

**WARNING:** Currently Telegram rarely accept new Templates for sites, so consider using another methods of getting IV. Your Template wouldn't be automatically applied to links from your website, you'll need to do this manually `(but you still can automate it a bit)`

If you know HTML at least a little bit and know [how to inspect element on site](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/dom/) â€” you'll be fine.

First of all, read the [Manual](https://instantview.telegram.org/docs), [XPath cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/xpath) and look at [Sample Templates](https://instantview.telegram.org/samples/).

After this you can go to [My Templates](https://instantview.telegram.org/my/) page, login via Telegram and try to write your first~~born~~ Template.

Didn't help? You can ask your question at Instant View groups: [En](https://t.me/IVpublic), [Ru](https://t.me/instantview_russian) or [Uz](https://t.me/ivpublic_uzbek).

### I created a Template, what's next?
Make sure that your Template can handle all articles with different content on your site, especially with complex ones: slideshows, embed/iframe, captions etc. 

![Submit Template Button](https://telegra.ph/file/5e9eea886f660d08236e1.png)

If you've checked 10+ pages on your site (by click on `Track Changes` button), you can submit your Template. There are ~0% chance that it'll be approved and applied to your site automatically.
 
Press `View in Telegram` button and get an IV link. It would look like this:
`https://t.me/iv?url=%YOUR_URL%&rhash=%YOUR_RHASH%`

Now you can create Instant View for any article by replacing `%YOUR_URL%` parameter. 

You can also automate it [with IFTTT](https://corbee.me/dev-to-instant-view#what-is-ifttt) or make link looks pretty using [@insvibot](https://t.me/insvibot).

## How can I get Instant View on my domain
Currently there are 4 ways to get Instant View for your website:
1. [Mimic a Medium page (fastest + easiest)](#How-to-mimic-a-Medium-page)
2. Create and use your own [Instant View Template](#How-to-create-my-own-Template?)
3. [Mimic a WordPress/Telegraph/Zen etc. (hardest)](#How-to-mimic-a-WP-page)
4. Suggest Telegram to make IV for your site ([press "Add Domain"](https://instantview.telegram.org/contest))

### How to mimic a Medium page
Original article: 
<related><a href="https://nikstar.me/blog/instant-view-for-custom-domain-v2">read on nikstar's blog</a></related>
Once Telegram think your page based on Medium blog platform â€” it will automatically try to parse it. And if your pages have standart HTML markup â€” your site will get Instant View
You can mimic a Medium page in 2 steps:
1. Add this meta tag in `<head>`: 
```html
<meta data-rh="true" property="al:android:app_name" content="Medium" />
```
2. Add (if doesn't exist) this meta tag:
 ```html
<meta property="article:published_time"/>
```
3. `(optional)` Add this to create Join button for your Telegram channel:
```html
<meta name="telegram:channel" content="@CHANNEL_USERNAME"/>
```
4. `(optional)` Also you can set up a preview by adding such tags:
```html
<meta property="og:site_name" content="SITE_NAME" />  
<meta property="og:description" content="DESCRIPTION" />  
<meta property="og:image" content="PREVIEW_IMAGE_URL" />  
<meta name="author" content="AUTHOR_NAME" />
```

Also, content of your page must be placed inside `<article>` tag.

<li>Go to go to <a href="https://instantview.telegram.org/my/">My Templates</a> page</li>
<li>Login via Telegram</li>
<li>Enter a URL of your page</li>
<li>Paste <a href="https://gist.github.com/cor-bee/6ca737429879714f2c7d6293e810f9e8">this Template</a></li>
</ol>
<p>You&#39;ll se error which prevents your page from caching on Telegram servers. You can ask your question at Instant View groups: <a href="https://t.me/IVpublic">En</a>, <a href="https://t.me/instantview_russian">Ru</a> or <a href="https://t.me/ivpublic_uzbek">Uz</a>.</p>

### How to mimic a WP page
Original article: 
<related><a href="https://nikstar.me/blog/instant-view-for-custom-domain">read on nikstar's blog</a></related>

TL;DR: You need to create a mirror of your article on site, which already has Instant View (wordpress.com, telegra.ph, zen.yandex.com etc.) and add a redirect for Telegram Bot on your server:
```javascript
if ( $http_user_agent ~ 'TelegramBot' ) {
    return 301 https://%username%.wordpress.com$request_uri;
}
```

Note: you can change `site_name` property only with Medium and Wordpress, on Telegraph and Yandex Zen `site_name` is locked.

## Can I ask Telegram to create IV for my domain?

Yes, you can and you should. It is simple â€” just open [IV site](https://instantview.telegram.org/contest) and press "Add domain".
![Add Domain](https://telegra.ph/file/d09f53c43340fcf2f6c44.png)
And wait.
Nobody knows, when would next contest begun (and would it begun at all), so... Keep optimistic.

And that's all, folks!
