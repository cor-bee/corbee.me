I love when there is no need to wait browser/app open to read new aricle. And I love automation.

So I created [DEV Telegram Channel](https://t.me/devtotg), where you can read dev.to articles. And you can do it **_INSTANTLY_**

## What is Instant View?

Instant View is a built-in Telegram tool which allow to read articles without huge loadtime. 

Main concept of IV is a Template. It tells Telegram severs what data to cache and what to remove.

So all process is simple:
1. Article send via Telegram
2. Telegram check for Template
3. Telegram scraps and caches article
4. Pure-HTML article provided to user

### What is Template?

Template is a code, which tell Telegram scraper what to do with page.

IV Template Language based on:
* YAML syntax
* XPath to select nodes
* RegEx to... RegExing üåö

This code is enough to scrap 50% articles on dev.to:
{% highlight yaml %}
~version: "2.1"
body:     //div[@id="article-body"] 
# Use <div id="article-body"> as main article
title:    //h1[0] 
# First h1 header on page used as title
{% endhighlight %}
Yes, 3 lines of code.

### How to use your Template?

Once you have finished your code on [My Templates page](https://instantview.telegram.org/my/), press "View in Telegram" button. You would get something like that:

Now you can create IV for any article using this template: `t.me/iv?url=LINK&rhash=XXX`

#### So now we have 2 goals:
1. Automate posting
2. Make a pretty post ~~and get rid of this ugly long link~~

## What is IFTTT?

[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) ("if this, then that") - service, which allows you to connect different services via Applets. Applet react on Trigger and respond with Action (e.g. post in Telegram with new RSS article)
![RUN.](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/5qghxi9haqgm1bdl5o5h.png)
All you need is create applet on [IFTTT Platform](https://platform.ifttt.com).

#### Hint how to make all look pretty
You can hide all ugly links in '‚Å†'  - narrow non-breaking space. Yes, there is a character between the quotes.

And as a result - a piece of perfectness:
